# Data Structures in C#
Data structures which I've implemented so far in C# (in accordance to my A-Level specification);

- [Arrays](https://github.com/krishhhyr/data-structures-c-sharp/blob/main/Arrays/Program.cs) (One-Dimensional, Two-Dimensional and Three-Dimensional)
- [Stacks](https://github.com/krishhhyr/data-structures-c-sharp/blob/main/Stacks/Program.cs) (Emulating via an array)
